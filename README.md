## 🚀 Getting Started

Welcome to the **rsync-backup-solution**! This application helps you create backups for your virtualized infrastructure. It uses **rsync** to provide fast, incremental backups. With this tool, you can quickly recover your entire system, ensuring high availability and peace of mind. 

### 🛠️ Requirements

To run this application, you will need:
- A computer with a Linux operating system (Ubuntu, CentOS, etc.).
- Basic command line knowledge (don’t worry, we’ll guide you!).
- **Rsync** installed on your system. You can typically install it via your package manager (use `sudo apt install rsync` for Ubuntu).

## 🔍 How to Use

First, you need to set your backup configuration. Open the `config.sh` file with a text editor. Update the paths to match your system and specify the backup location. For example:

This command will start the backup process. The software will copy only the changes since your last backup, making it quick and efficient.
